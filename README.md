### Hello there 👋

I am Gerald! 

I’m a **software craftsman**, currently working @[Softway Medical](https://www.softwaymedical.fr/).  
💪 We try to improve healthcare systems by developing and operating information systems for health institutions and radiology practices!

Part of my work is to **empower our development teams**, bringing them autonomy and helping them focus on bringing value faster and safer.  
🔭 I'm currently working on the means of provisioning our microservices on-premises. 😱

🌱 I’m currently going down the rabbit hole of studying **Deep Learning**.
